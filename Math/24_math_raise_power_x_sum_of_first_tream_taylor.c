/*
Write a C program to calculate e raise to the power x using sum of first n terms of Taylor Series. 
From Wikipedia,
In mathematics, a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are 
calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point.
Example:
The Taylor series for any polynomial is the polynomial itself.
C programming Exercises: Math - Taylor Series
The above expansion holds because the derivative of ex with respect to x is also ex, and e0 equals 1.
This leaves the terms (x âˆ’ 0)n in the numerator and n! in the denominator for each term in the infinite sum.
Example 1:
Input: n = 25
float x= 5.0
Output: e^x = 148.413162
