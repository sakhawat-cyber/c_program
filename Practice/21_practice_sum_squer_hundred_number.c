/*
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Write a C programming to find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. Go to the editor
Expected Output:

25164150
