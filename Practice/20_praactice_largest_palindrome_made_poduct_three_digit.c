/*
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as taco cat or madam or racecar or the number 10801. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Write a C programming to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
Expected Output:

906609
